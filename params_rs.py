I think this goes without saying, when running RS runs with us, you shouldn't be doing it with the intent to disrupt anyones gameplay. \
\n\
2.**Cooperate With Everyone** \
This should be obvious as well. The game is designed to reward teamwork. To ensure the smoothest run possible, you must communicate with other players - members of the Penguin Horde or not. This means that: \n\
‚Ä¢You will ping planet sectors before engaging them, wait and listen for any concerns other players may express. Also, pay attention to the chat at all times. \
‚Ä¢Make sure you and your team pick planets centralised, that are accessible to everyone, and have enough artifacts to be worthwhile (unless you decide on otherwise). \
‚Ä¢If you have anything to suggest during the run, say it! This is about teamwork after all, and you are part of the team. \n\
‚Ä¢Try not to abandon the run, unless forced to of course by any unforeseen circumstances. \
3. **This service is for in-corp RS runs** \
This means that you will have to join a corporation of the Penguin Horde, that will be agreed upon by the member users. This rules do not apply to club runs hosted by Penguin Horde.\
\n\
4. **Be civil at all times** \
If you come to any disagreements with anyone during your RS run, before it or after it, please be civil. Anything can be solved with mature discussion. \
\n\
5. **If you break any of the above terms** \
Really, it depends on the severity of your action. There may not even be a warning, or you may even loose access to this service or get banned from the server overall. Know that you have absolutely nothing to worry about if all you plan on is getting some arts and enjoying a RS run with some good company. \
\n\
Now, i know some of you may have skipped down here to just find the command that will give you access without reading the above conditions. Please read them, so we dont have any misunderstandings. \n\
Anyways, use !agree to get access to the RS queue. \
If at any point you wish to no longer have access, use !leave. We are happy you are choosing to run Red Stars with us!"
